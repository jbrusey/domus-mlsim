#+title: DOMUS ML-Simulator
#+author: James Brusey
* Introduction
This is an interface to machine learnt simulators written in Python developed as part of the H2020 EU DOMUS project http://domus-project.eu 

* Installation
The simplest way to install is first install miniconda https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html or Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and then use the command line as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
conda env create -f ml.yml
#+END_SRC
This will create a conda environment called ~ml~ that can be activated using:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
conda activate ml
#+END_SRC

* Updating the install
After =git pull= and particularly if ~ml.yml~ got updated, you can update the installed packages using:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
conda env update -n ml -f ml.yml
#+END_SRC

* Testing your installation
To ensure that you have everything installed ok, use:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd src
python -m pytest ../tests
#+END_SRC
If this produces errors, it may indicate that you are missing some packages or haven't activated the conda environment.

** Notes

1. =pytest= command does not include the current directory in PYTHONPATH. Make sure you use the =python -m pytest= form.
